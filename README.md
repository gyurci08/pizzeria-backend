# PizzeriaBackend

## Description

This was an end of semester project. Though I have made a lot of mistakes and did not complete it, I learnt a lot.
PizzeriaBackend is a robust server-side application designed to power a pizza ordering system.
It would handle crucial operations such as order processing, user management, menu item management, and delivery
tracking.
This backend serves as the core engine for the Pizzeria application, providing RESTful API endpoints for seamless
integration with the frontend.
